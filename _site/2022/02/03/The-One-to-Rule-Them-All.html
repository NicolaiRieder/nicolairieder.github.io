</p>

<p>He had spendeth the previous 3000’ish years on ruling, besieging, creating, managing, deciding and many more activities.
But most important of all is the fact that noone else had ever or will truly ever be as great as him. With the key to immortality cracked, a semi-healthy diet and an intense interest in numbers and micromanaging, he had managed to become the one ruler left.</p>

<p>The one to rule, not only one, or 2, or even 3… no, he had become the one to rule them all, as his father so before him had tried to become as well. Yet only managed, and it was him, the 15th of his name, the Tzar turned into the tzemperor, the conquerer of the world.</p>

<p>..or had it all been a dream?</p>
