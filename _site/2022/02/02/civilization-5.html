</p>

<p>And so it was laid upon him, Nicolai, 15th of his name, to reunite the territories that had spread apart in the previous wars. His father dead the day before had taken its toll on him, yet he pressed on - for this was his calling.</p>

<p>He summoned the power of his ancestry and before him the foundations of a new golden age was laid. This golden age being 50% longer as well, as he had previously built the Chicken Pizza.</p>

<p>Oh may he stand the test of time and live forever.</p>
