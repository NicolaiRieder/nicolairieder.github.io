I".<p>And so it has come to this. I can no longer exist on this earth without at least trying to make contact to the forbidden ones once again.
Even though I know it might be the end of me I can feel it pulling me in.</p>

<p>I must recite the phrases of the old ones. It has to be done, and so this chance has been bestowed upon me.. the time is nigh.</p>

<p>And so in the 4th chora I call upon ye, Gabriel, Beelzebub, Mario and Cthulu. I need your strength to dominate this world as I was intended to do.
In the 3rd chora I hereby summoneth thee, Sonic the Hedgethhogeth, Ezio Auditore, The one they call the Dragonborneth and Pikachu.</p>

<p>I need you to.. no.. arrrrrrgh. IT HURTS!!!!! Donâ€™t! I only wanted to assume the position I was meant to.. please spare me oh great ones..</p>

<p><em>silence</em></p>
