And so it has come to this. I can no longer exist on this earth without at least trying to make contact to the forbidden ones once again.
Even though I know it might be the end of me I can feel it pulling me in.

I must recite the phrases of the old ones. It has to be done, and so this chance has been bestowed upon me.. the time is nigh.

And so in the 4th chora I call upon ye, Gabriel, Beelzebub, Mario and Cthulu. I need your strength to dominate this world as I was intended to do.
In the 3rd chora I hereby summoneth thee, Sonic the Hedgethhogeth, Ezio Auditore, The one they call the Dragonborneth and Pikachu.

I need you to.. no.. arrrrrrgh. IT HURTS!!!!! Don't! I only wanted to assume the position I was meant to.. please spare me oh great ones..

*silence*
